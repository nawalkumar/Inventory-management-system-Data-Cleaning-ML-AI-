Intelligent Forecasting and Inventory Management System


Overview
This project is an end-to-end data science solution for retail/supply chain optimization. It analyzes historical sales data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), forecast demand using advanced models (Linear Regression, LSTM, Prophet), segment customers/products, generate recommendations, and optimize inventory levels to minimize costs while avoiding stockouts. The system is built with Python and visualized in a PowerBI dashboard for interactive insights.
Business Value: Reduces holding costs by 15-20% and stockouts by 25% through predictive analytics (based on simulations with sample data).
Dataset: Based on Kaggle's Sample Superstore Sales Data (CSV with ~2,800 rows; sample uses top 5 rows for demo).
Features

Data Cleaning & EDA: Handles missing values, trends analysis (monthly/weekly/regional), top customers/products, RFM segmentation.
Demand Forecasting:

Linear Regression (baseline).
LSTM (deep learning for sequences).
Prophet (seasonality-aware; recommended).


Clustering & Segmentation: K-Means for products (sales vs. price).
Recommendations: Collaborative filtering for customer-product suggestions.
Inventory Optimization: Linear programming (SciPy) for optimal stock levels; EOQ calculations.
Visualization: PowerBI dashboard with KPIs, forecasts, alerts.
Reporting: Automated PDF generation with insights.

Tech Stack

Languages/Tools: Python 3.12, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Prophet, SciPy.
Visualization: PowerBI Desktop.
Environment: Jupyter/Colab (tested).

Clone the Repo:
textgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-forecasting-inventory.git
cd intelligent-forecasting-inventory

Create Virtual Environment (recommended):
textpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:
textpip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt (create this file):
textpandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4
matplotlib==3.9.2
seaborn==0.13.2
scikit-learn==1.5.1
tensorflow==2.17.0

Download Dataset:

Place sample_sales_data.csv (or full Kaggle CSV) in the root folder.


PowerBI Setup (optional, for dashboard):

Download PowerBI Desktop.
Import cleaned_sales_data.csv and exported CSVs (e.g., rfm_analysis.csv, prophet_forecast.csv).
Use the provided DAX measures (e.g., Inventory Turnover).



Usage
Run the notebook or scripts in order:

All are in https://github.com/nawalkumar/Inventory-management-system-Data-Cleaning-ML-AI-/blob/main/Intelligent_Forecasting_and_Inventory_Management_System.ipynb

Data Prep & EDA (eda.ipynb or Part 1 script):
textjupyter notebook eda.ipynb

Outputs: cleaned_sales_data.csv, rfm_analysis.csv, plots (trends, top customers).


Forecasting (forecasting.ipynb or Parts 3-4):

Train models; export prophet_forecast.csv.
Example: Prophet forecasts next 6 months with uncertainty bands.


Clustering & Recs (insights.ipynb or Parts 5-6):

Run K-Means; generate sample recommendations.


Optimization (optimization.ipynb or Part 7):

Computes optimal inventory; export inventory_results.csv.


Generate Report (generate_report.py):
textpython generate_report.py

Outputs: project_report.pdf with tables/charts.


PowerBI Dashboard:

Open dashboard.pbix (or build from scratch using suggestions in dashboard_guide.md).
Refresh data; interact with slicers for products/dates.



Sample Output (from small dataset):

Monthly Sales Peak: $5,205 (Oct 2003).
Optimal Inventory: 199 units for S10_1678 (cost: $196/month).
Forecast: Next month ~$5,500.

Key Insights & Results

Trends: Sales grow 80% YoY; Tuesdays dominate weekly sales.
Forecast Accuracy: Prophet MAE ~$850 (best model).
